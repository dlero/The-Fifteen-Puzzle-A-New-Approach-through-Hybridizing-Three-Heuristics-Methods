# The-Fifteen-Puzzle-A-New-Approach-through-Hybridizing-Three-Heuristics-Methods
The Fifteen Puzzle has long fascinated math enthusiasts due to its vast state space with approximately 10^13 states to explore. This study utilized the Bidirectional A* (BA*) search algorithm and three heuristics - Manhattan distance (MD), linear conflict (LC), and walking distance (WD) - to solve the problem.
